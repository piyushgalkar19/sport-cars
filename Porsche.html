<p><b>The Iconic Porsche Carrera GT</b><br>
The Porsche Carrera GT (Type 980), produced from 2003 to 2006, is a legendary analog supercar known for its raw driving experience, motorsport-derived engineering, and timeless design. Born from a canceled Le Mans prototype project, it stands as one of the last true hypercars with a manual transmission and no significant electronic safety nets. 
<ul>
<h2>Key Features & Engineering</h2>
<li><h3>V10 Engine:</h3> The heart of the Carrera GT is its naturally aspirated 5.7-liter V10 engine, initially developed for Formula 1 racing. It produces an astonishing 603 hp (612 PS) at 8,000 rpm and is famous for its distinct, high-pitched exhaust note.</li>
<li><h3>Lightweight Construction:</h3> The car was a pioneer in using a pure carbon fibermonocoque and subframe, which provided high structural rigidity and a low curb weight of approximately 3,042 lbs (1,380 kg).</li>
<li><h3>Manual Transmission:</h3> The only available transmission was a traditional 6-speed manual gearbox paired with a compact, race-derived ceramic composite clutch (PCCC), which demands precision and skill from the driver.</li>
<li><h3>Aerodynamics:</h3> The sleek body features large side air inlets for cooling and an electronically operated rear wing that automatically deploys at speeds above 70 mph (113 km/h) to reduce lift. </li>
